# asutilities

Contains a collection of useful classes that I am making available with MIT license.
This includes the following:

 * An AudioBuffer class that handles channels, mixing, adding sine waves, generating noise
 * An AudioFileManager class that allows to read and write a lot of formats. This class has been tested with Android/iOs/Mac Os/ Linux and for each platform, it automatically selects the widest number of usable backends, among the following: Core Audio Audiofile utilities (all the Quicktime formats), libsndfile, Lib OGG Vorbis, aac-Lib.
 * StringUtilities.h contains a vast collection of methods for tokenizing, getting file extensions, getting absolute/relative paths.
Extra licenses! Please mind that each backend has is own licensing terms
